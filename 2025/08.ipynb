    "\n",
    "**Setup:** You have junction boxes at 3D coordinates (x, y, z). You need to connect them with \"string lights.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "1. Find the two closest junction boxes (by Euclidean distance) and connect them\n",
    "2. Repeat: always connect the next closest pair that aren't **already directly connected**\n",
    "3. Connections form \"circuits\" — if A connects to B, and B connects to C, they're all in one circuit (this is the **Union-Find** pattern!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key detail:** Even if two boxes are already in the same circuit (indirectly connected), you still make the connection if they're the closest unconnected pair — it just doesn't change the circuit structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** After making the **1000 shortest connections**, multiply the sizes of the **three largest circuits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample shows that after 10 connections on 20 boxes, you get circuits of sizes 5, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 → answer is 5 × 4 × 2 = 40.\n",

    "2. Sort pairs by distance\n",
    "3. Use Union-Find to track which boxes are in which circuit\n",
    "4. Process the 1000 shortest connections\n",
