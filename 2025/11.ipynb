    "One of the Elves notices you and rushes over. \"It's a good thing you're here! We just installed a new server rack, but we aren't having any luck getting the reactor to communicate with it!\" You glance around the room and see a tangle of cables and devices running from the server rack to the reactor. She rushes off, returning a moment later with a list of the devices and their outputs (your puzzle input).\n",

    "The Elves are pretty sure that the issue isn't due to any specific device, but rather that the issue is triggered by data following some specific path through the devices. Data only ever flows from a device through its outputs; it can't flow backwards.\n",

    "To help the Elves figure out which path is causing the issue, they need you to find every path from you to out.\n",
