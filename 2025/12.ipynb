    "The presents come in a few standard but very weird shapes. The shapes and the regions into which they need to fit are all measured in standard units. To be aesthetically pleasing, the presents need to be placed into the regions in a way that follows a standardized two-dimensional unit grid; you also can't stack presents.\n",

The rest of the line describes the presents that need to fit into that region by listing the quantity of each shape of present; 1 0 1 0 3 2 means you need to fit one present with shape index 0, no presents with shape index 1, one present with shape index 2, no presents with shape index 3, three presents with shape index 4, and two presents with shape index 5.\n",

    "Presents can be rotated and flipped as necessary to make them fit in the available space, but they have to always be placed perfectly on the grid. Shapes can't overlap (that is, the # part from two different presents can't go in the same place on the grid), but they can fit together (that is, the . part in a present's shape's diagram does not block another present from occupying that space on the grid).\n",

    "AAA.\n",
    "ABAB\n",
    "ABAB\n",
    ".BBB\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second region, 12x5: 1 0 1 0 2 2, is 12 units wide and 5 units long. In that region, you need to try to fit one present with shape index 0, one present with shape index 2, two presents with shape index 4, and two presents with shape index 5.\n",
