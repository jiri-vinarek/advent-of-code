    "**The Setup:**\n",
    "- Each claw machine has two buttons (A and B) that move the claw\n",
    "- Button A costs 3 tokens, Button B costs 1 token\n",
    "- Each button moves the claw a specific distance in X and Y directions\n",
    "- You need to position the claw exactly at the prize location\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Goal:**\n",
    "Find the minimum number of tokens needed to win all possible prizes across all machines in your input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Constraints:**\n",
    "- Each button can be pressed at most 100 times\n",
    "- Some machines might be impossible to win (no valid combination exists)\n",
    "- You need exact positioning - the claw must land precisely on the prize coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "For the first machine, pressing A 80 times and B 40 times gets you to the prize for 280 tokens total (80×3 + 40×1).\n",
