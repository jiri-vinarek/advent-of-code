    "Great job solving both parts! Let me reflect on your solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What works well:**\n",
    "- Your use of `cmp_to_key` with a custom comparator is a clean approach for sorting with rules\n",
    "- The functional style with `.filter()` and `.map()` makes the logic easy to follow\n",
    "- You correctly identified that rules act as a partial ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential improvements to consider:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency concern:** Your `comp` function checks if tuples are in the full `rules` list. For part 2, you could filter rules per update (like you did conceptually in part 1) to only check relevant rules. Would this make lookups faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edge case:** What happens if `comp` returns 0 (no rule exists between two pages)? Does the sort still work correctly? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code reuse:** You're parsing the input twice in `solve` and `solve_part2`. Could you refactor to parse once?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these (if any) interests you to explore further?"
