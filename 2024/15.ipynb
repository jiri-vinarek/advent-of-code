    "- You have a warehouse map with walls (#), boxes (O), and a robot (@)\n",
    "- The robot will follow a sequence of movement commands: `^` (up), `v` (down), `<` (left), `>` (right)\n",

    "**The Rules:**\n",
    "- When the robot moves, if there's a box in the way, it tries to push the box\n",
    "- If pushing would cause the robot or box to hit a wall, nothing moves at all\n",
    "- Boxes can push other boxes in a chain\n",

    "**GPS Coordinate Formula:**\n",

If any box in the chain would hit a wall, nothing moves at all—not even the robot.\n",
