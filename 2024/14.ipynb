    "To get The Historian safely to the bathroom, you'll need a way to predict where the robots will be in the future. Fortunately, they all seem to be moving on the tile floor in predictable straight lines.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Each robot's velocity is given as v=x,y where x and y are given in tiles per second. Positive x means the robot is moving to the right, and positive y means the robot is moving down. So, a velocity of v=1,-2 means that each second, the robot moves 1 tile to the right and 2 tiles up.\n",

    "The robots are good at navigating over/under each other (due to a combination of springs, extendable legs, and quadcopters), so they can share the same tile and don't interact with each other. Visually, the number of robots on each tile in this example looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "- Robots move on a grid that's 101 tiles wide and 103 tiles tall\n",
    "- Each robot has a position (p=x,y) and velocity (v=x,y)\n",
    "- Robots move in straight lines at constant velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key mechanics:**\n",
    "- The grid wraps around (teleportation) - when a robot goes off one edge, it appears on the opposite edge\n",
    "- Robots can occupy the same tile without interacting\n",
    "\n",
    "**The task:**\n",
    "- Simulate the robots' positions after exactly 100 seconds\n",
    "- Divide the grid into 4 quadrants (ignoring the middle row and middle column)\n",
    "- Count how many robots are in each quadrant\n",
    "- Multiply these four counts together to get the \"safety factor\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you need to figure out:**\n",
    "- How to calculate each robot's position after 100 seconds with wrapping\n",
    "- How to determine which quadrant each robot is in (excluding middle lines)\n",
    "- The final safety factor\n",

    "- A robot at position (x, y) with velocity (vx, vy) returns to its start when both x and y coordinates cycle back\n",
